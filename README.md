* a way to extract graphical assets from cps2 roms

# What it do (now)
* interleaves the 8 files that contain the EPROM dumps
into 2 files that can be opened in a tile editor as 
'4bpp planar' with 16x16 rows interleaving

to run the rom 
* converts the binary needed for the 8x8 and 16x16 tiles
into .bmp files
